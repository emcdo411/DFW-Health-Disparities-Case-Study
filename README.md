# DFW Health Disparities Case Study: Sickle Cell, Hypertension, PTSD, and Anxiety/Depression

## Overview

This case study examines health disparities in the Dallas-Fort Worth (DFW) metroplex, focusing on:
1. **Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) and Hypertension Among African Americans:** Analyzes prevalence and hospitalization trends.
2. **PTSD Among Veterans:** Assesses prevalence, hospitalization trends, and identifies high-risk areas.
3. **Anxiety and Depression Among Middle-Aged Women (Ages 40–59):** Evaluates treatment-seeking trends and high-risk areas.

Using real data from the CDC, U.S. Census, and national health statistics, we employ advanced visualizations in R—including bar charts, line graphs, 3D plots, and an interactive 2D map—to provide actionable insights. The study also highlights Mayo Clinic’s interventions and performs predictive analysis to identify areas in DFW most at risk for PTSD and anxiety, making them prime candidates for targeted case studies.

## Background

The DFW metroplex, with a population of over 7.6 million (2020 Census), faces significant health disparities:
- **SCD and Hypertension:** African Americans (15.4% of DFW population, ~1.17 million) are disproportionately affected by SCD (1 in 365 newborns) and hypertension (33% prevalence).
- **PTSD in Veterans:** With ~250,000 veterans in DFW, 7–14% experience PTSD, particularly those deployed to Iraq/Afghanistan.
- **Anxiety and Depression in Middle-Aged Women:** About 20% of women aged 40–59 (~1.14 million in DFW) experience anxiety, and 15% experience depression.

This case study uses real data to quantify these issues, identify high-risk areas, and highlight Mayo Clinic’s interventions, providing a comprehensive view of health challenges in DFW.

- **Code:**

```R

## Mayo Clinic Interventions

- **SCD:** Gene editing therapies, hydroxyurea, and transcranial Doppler screenings to reduce stroke risk.
- **Hypertension:** Community-based programs, lifestyle interventions (e.g., DASH diet), and telehealth for better access.
- **PTSD in Veterans:** Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR), Transcendental Meditation (TM), and telehealth for cognitive processing therapy (CPT) and EMDR.
- **Anxiety and Depression in Women:** Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT), community outreach, and telehealth CBT and pharmacotherapy.

## Why It Matters

Health disparities in DFW have profound impacts:
- **SCD and Hypertension:** SCD reduces life expectancy by 20 years, while hypertension doubles stroke risk for African Americans, with Dallas and Tarrant Counties most affected.
- **PTSD in Veterans:** Affects 26,250 veterans, leading to 5,250 annual hospitalizations, increasing risks of suicide and homelessness.
- **Anxiety and Depression in Women:** Impacts 399,000 middle-aged women, affecting caregiving and economic productivity, particularly in high-risk areas like Dallas County.

Mayo Clinic’s interventions can address these challenges, improving outcomes in a region where social vulnerability exacerbates health issues.

## Conclusion

This case study provides a comprehensive analysis of health disparities in the DFW metroplex, using real data to quantify the prevalence of SCD, hypertension, PTSD, and anxiety/depression. Advanced visualizations—including bar charts, line graphs, 3D plots, and an interactive 2D map—highlight trends and high-risk areas, with Dallas County identified as the most critical for intervention. Mayo Clinic’s innovative approaches offer promising solutions, making this study a valuable resource for healthcare professionals aiming to reduce disparities in DFW.
